- en: ðŸ¤— AutoTrain is a no-code tool for training state-of-the-art models for Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) tasks, for Computer Vision (CV) tasks, and for Speech
    tasks and even for Tabular tasks. It is built on top of the awesome tools developed
    by the Hugging Face team, and it is designed to be easy to use.

- en: AutoTrain is for anyone who wants to train a state-of-the-art model for a NLP,
    CV, Speech or Tabular task, but doesnâ€™t want to spend time on the technical details
    of training a model. AutoTrain is also for anyone who wants to train a model for
    a custom dataset, but doesnâ€™t want to spend time on the technical details of training
    a model. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to train a state-of-the-art model
    for any task and our focus is not just data scientists or machine learning engineers,
    but also non-technical users.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AutoTrain Advanced processes your data either in a Hugging Face Space or locally
    (if installed locally using pip). This saves one time since the data processing
    is not done by the AutoTrain backend, resulting in your job not being queued.
    AutoTrain Advanced also allows you to use your own hardware (better CPU and RAM)
    to process the data, thus, making the data processing faster.

- en: Using AutoTrain Advanced, advanced users can also control the hyperparameters
    used for training per job. This allows you to train multiple models with different
    hyperparameters and compare the results.

    train models for NLP, CV, Speech and Tabular tasks.

- en: We recommend using [AutoTrain Advanced](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=autotrain-projects/autotrain-advanced)
    since it is faster, more flexible and will have more supported tasks and features
    in the future.

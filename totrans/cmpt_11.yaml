- en: When you make a submission, both the public and private leaderboard scores are
    calculated but only the public leaderboard score is displayed. When a competition
    is over, the private leaderboard score is revealed and the final rankings are
    calculated based on that. You can select N submissions to be considered for the
    private leaderboard score calculation. The value of N will be mentioned in the
    problem statement by the organizers.

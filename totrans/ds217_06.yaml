- en: Welcome to the 🤗 Datasets tutorials! These beginner-friendly tutorials will
    guide you through the fundamentals of working with 🤗 Datasets. You’ll load and
    prepare a dataset for training with your machine learning framework of choice.
    Along the way, you’ll learn how to load different dataset configurations and splits,
    interact with and see what’s inside your dataset, preprocess, and share a dataset
    to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

    like PyTorch or TensorFlow. If you’re already familiar with these, feel free to
    check out the [quickstart](./quickstart) to see what you can do with 🤗 Datasets.

    Learning via Sequence Modeling‚Äù by Chen L. et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01345).
    It abstracts Reinforcement Learning as a conditional-sequence modeling problem.'

    fitting a value function, that will tell us what action to take to maximize the
    return (cumulative reward), **we use a sequence modeling algorithm (Transformer)
    that, given a desired return, past states, and actions, will generate future actions
    to achieve this desired return**. It‚Äôs an autoregressive model conditioned on
    the desired return, past states, and actions to generate future actions that achieve
    the desired return.

- en: This is a complete shift in the Reinforcement Learning paradigm since we use
    generative trajectory modeling (modeling the joint distribution of the sequence
    of states, actions, and rewards) to replace conventional RL algorithms. This means
    that in Decision Transformers, we don‚Äôt maximize the return but rather generate
    a series of future actions that achieve the desired return.

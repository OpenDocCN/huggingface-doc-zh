- en: Unconditional image generation generates images that look like a random sample
    from the training data the model was trained on because the denoising process
    is not guided by any additional context like text or image.

- en: To get started, use the [DiffusionPipeline](/docs/diffusers/v0.26.3/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline)
    to load the [anton-l/ddpm-butterflies-128](https://huggingface.co/anton-l/ddpm-butterflies-128)
    checkpoint to generate images of butterflies. The [DiffusionPipeline](/docs/diffusers/v0.26.3/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline)
    downloads and caches all the model components required to generate an image.

- en: You can also try experimenting with the `num_inference_steps` parameter, which
    controls the number of denoising steps. More denoising steps typically produce
    higher quality images, but itâ€™ll take longer to generate. Feel free to play around
    with this parameter to see how it affects the image quality.

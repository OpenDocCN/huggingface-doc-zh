- en: '**Gradio** provides an easy and intuitive interface for running a model from
    a list of inputs and displaying the outputs in formats such as images, audio,
    3D objects, and more. Gradio now even has a [Plot output component](https://gradio.app/docs/#o_plot)
    for creating data visualizations with Matplotlib, Bokeh, and Plotly! For more
    details, take a look at the [Getting started](https://gradio.app/getting_started/)
    guide from the Gradio team.'

    will initialize your Space with the latest version of Gradio by setting the `sdk`
    property to `gradio` in your `README.md` fileâ€™s YAML block. If youâ€™d like to change
    the Gradio version, you can edit the `sdk_version` property.

    it, and deploying your code to it. Weâ€™ll create a **Hot Dog Classifier** Space
    with Gradio thatâ€™ll be used to demo the [julien-c/hotdog-not-hotdog](https://huggingface.co/julien-c/hotdog-not-hotdog)
    model, which can detect whether a given picture contains a hot dog ðŸŒ­

    meaning that you can work on your Space incrementally (and collaboratively) by
    pushing commits. Take a look at the [Getting Started with Repositories](./repositories-getting-started)
    guide to learn about how you can create and edit files before continuing.

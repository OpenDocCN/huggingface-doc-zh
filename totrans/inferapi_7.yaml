- en: The free Inference API may be rate limited for heavy use cases. We try to balance
    the loads evenly between all our available resources, and favoring steady flows
    of requests. If your account suddenly sends 10k requests then you’re likely to
    receive 503 errors saying models are loading. In order to prevent that, you should
    instead try to start running queries smoothly from 0 to 10k over the course of
    a few minutes.

- en: You can run private models by default! If you don’t see them on your [Hugging
    Face](https://huggingface.co) page please make sure you are logged in. Within
    the API make sure you include your token, otherwise your model will be declared
    as non existent.

- en: You can. Please check the model card for any licensing issue that might arise,
    but most public models are delivered by researchers and are usable within commercial
    products. But please double check.

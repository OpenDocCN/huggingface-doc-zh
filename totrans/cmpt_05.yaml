    evaluation metric and the hardware used.

- en: To create a competition, you need to have a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)
    account. You will also need a write token which will be used throughout the competition
    to upload data and submissions. Please note that the write token is private and
    should not be shared with anyone and must not be refreshed during the course of
    the competition. In case you decide to refresh the token, you will need to update
    the token in the competition space’s settings otherwise the competitors will not
    be able to upload submissions and competition will stop working. You can find/generate
    a write token [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

    a new organization or use an existing one that you are already a member of. You
    can create a new organization [here](https://huggingface.co/organizations/new).

    do so in organization settings. NOTE: your payment method will not be charged
    if you are using the free tier of the platform (generic competitions hosted on

    a CSV file (or any other file) containing the predictions for the whole test set.
    The predictions are then evaluated against solution.csv (or a solution file) using
    the evaluation metric provided by the competition creator. These competitions
    are easy to setup and free to host (if you use cpu-basic). You can improve the
    evaluation runtime by upgrading generic competitions to cpu-upgrade. For generic
    competition, all the test data (without labels) is available to the participants
    all the time.'

    a python script that takes in the test set and outputs the predictions. The predictions
    are then evaluated against solution.csv (or a solution file) using the evaluation
    metric provided by the competition creator. These competitions are only free to
    host if you use cpu-basic as the backend for evaluation, and this is not recommended!
    In script competition, the test data can be kept private. The participants wont
    be able to see the test data at all. The participants submit a huggingface model
    repo containing `script.py` which is run to generate predictions on hidden test
    data.'

    system* where our agent was alone in its environment: it was **not cooperating
    or collaborating with other agents**.'

    interaction with other agents. And so, our **goal is to create agents that can
    interact with other humans and other agents**.

    in a *multi-agents system* to build robust agents that can adapt, collaborate,
    or compete.

    reinforcement learning (MARL)**.

    agent will compete against other classmates’ agents every day and be ranked on

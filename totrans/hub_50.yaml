- en: At Hugging Face, we build a collaboration platform for the ML community (i.e.,
    the Hub), and we **monetize by providing simple access to compute for AI**, with
    services like AutoTrain, Spaces and Inference Endpoints, directly accessible from
    the Hub, and billed by Hugging Face to the credit card on file.

- en: We also partner with cloud providers, like [AWS](https://huggingface.co/blog/aws-partnership)
    and [Azure](https://huggingface.co/blog/hugging-face-endpoints-on-azure), to make
    it easy for customers to use Hugging Face directly in their cloud of choice. These
    solutions and usage are billed directly by the cloud provider. Ultimately we want
    people to be able to have great options to use Hugging Face wherever they build
    Machine Learning.

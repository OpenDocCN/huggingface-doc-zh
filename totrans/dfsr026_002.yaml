- en: ðŸ¤— Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models
    for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether youâ€™re
    looking for a simple inference solution or want to train your own diffusion model,
    ðŸ¤— Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with
    a focus on [usability over performance](conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance),
    [simple over easy](conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability
    over abstractions](conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction).

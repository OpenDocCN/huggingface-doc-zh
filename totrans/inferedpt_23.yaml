- en: You can `pause` & `resume` endpoints to save cost and configurations. Please
    note that if your endpoint is in a `failed` state, you will need to create a new
    endpoint. To `pause`/`resume` your endpoint, navigate to the “overview” tab and
    click the button at top right corner, which will show “Pause endpoint” to pause,
    or “Resume endpoint” to reactivate the paused endpoint.

- en: 'When pausing an endpoint the min & max number of replicas will be set to 0\.
    When resuming an endpoint the min & max number of replicas will be set to 1\.
    This allows you to programmatically pause and resume your endpoint by updating
    the “min_replicas” and “max_replicas” fields in the API. Paused inference endpoints
    will have the following status: `PAUSED`. Paused endpoints will be NOT be billed
    until resumed. Pausing & Resuming an endpoint is a great way to save costs when
    you don’t need your endpoint to be running. For example, you can easily pause
    your endpoint during the night or weekends. You should pause your endpoint when
    you don’t need it for the time being.'

    it. This means that you can pause your endpoint and resume it later without having
    to update your code.

    You can see the status change of your endpoint in the “overview” tab to `PAUSED`.
    If you do not see the `PAUSED` status make sure you’ve followed these instructions
    or contact us for help.

    then to `Running`. Once your endpoint is running, you can start using it again
    and billing usage will incur.

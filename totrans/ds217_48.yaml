- en: Each dataset should have a dataset card to promote responsible usage and inform
    users of any potential biases within the dataset. This idea was inspired by the
    Model Cards proposed by [Mitchell, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993). Dataset
    cards help users understand a dataset’s contents, the context for using the dataset,
    how it was created, and any other considerations a user should be aware of.

    add a license, language, pretty_name, the task_categories, size_categories, and
    any other tags that you think are relevant. These tags help users discover and
    find your dataset on the Hub.

- en: For a complete, but not required, set of tag options you can also look at the
    [Dataset Card specifications](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/blob/main/datasetcard.md?plain=1).
    This’ll have a few more tag options like `multilinguality` and `language_creators`
    which are useful but not absolutely necessary.

    template with all the relevant fields to complete. Fill out the template sections
    to the best of your ability. Take a look at the [Dataset Card Creation Guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md)
    for more detailed information about what to include in each section of the card.
    For fields you are unable to complete, you can write **[More Information Needed]**.

    splits and/or configurations](./repository_structure#define-your-splits-and-subsets-in-yaml)
    without the need to write any code.

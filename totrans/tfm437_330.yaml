- en: '*This paper presents XLSR which learns cross-lingual speech representations
    by pretraining a single model from the raw waveform of speech in multiple languages.
    We build on wav2vec 2.0 which is trained by solving a contrastive task over masked
    latent speech representations and jointly learns a quantization of the latents
    shared across languages. The resulting model is fine-tuned on labeled data and
    experiments show that cross-lingual pretraining significantly outperforms monolingual
    pretraining. On the CommonVoice benchmark, XLSR shows a relative phoneme error
    rate reduction of 72% compared to the best known results. On BABEL, our approach
    improves word error rate by 16% relative compared to a comparable system. Our
    approach enables a single multilingual speech recognition model which is competitive
    to strong individual models. Analysis shows that the latent discrete speech representations
    are shared across languages with increased sharing for related languages. We hope
    to catalyze research in low-resource speech understanding by releasing XLSR-53,
    a large model pretrained in 53 languages.*'

- en: XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model was trained using connectionist temporal classification
    (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded using [Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.37.2/en/model_doc/wav2vec2#transformers.Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer).

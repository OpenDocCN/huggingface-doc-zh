- en: Kandinsky 2.2 is a multilingual text-to-image model capable of producing more
    photorealistic images. The model includes an image prior model for creating image
    embeddings from text prompts, and a decoder model that generates images based
    on the prior model‚Äôs embeddings. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll find two separate scripts in
    Diffusers for Kandinsky 2.2, one for training the prior model and one for training
    the decoder model. You can train both models separately, but to get the best results,
    you should train both the prior and decoder models.

    supported for the prior model!), `mixed_precision`, and `gradient_accumulation_steps`
    to help fit the model into memory and to speedup training. You can reduce your
    memory-usage even more by enabling memory-efficient attention with [xFormers](../optimization/xformers)
    (version [v0.0.16](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/2234#issuecomment-1416931212)

    it easy to share and load models from the ðŸ¤— Hub.

    for the sake of this tutorial.

- en: Letâ€™s pretend weâ€™ve now fine-tuned the model. The next step would be to push
    it to the Hub! We can do this with the `timm.models.hub.push_to_hf_hub` function.

    on the Hub. You can now share this model with your friends, or use it in your
    own code!

- en: Loading a model from the Hub is as simple as calling `timm.create_model` with
    the `pretrained` argument set to the name of the model you want to load. In this
    case, weâ€™ll use [`nateraw/resnet18-random`](https://huggingface.co/nateraw/resnet18-random),
    which is the model we just pushed to the Hub.

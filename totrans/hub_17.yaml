- en: If a model on the Hub is tied to a [supported library](./models-libraries),
    loading the model can be done in just a few lines. For information on accessing
    the model, you can click on the ‚ÄúUse in *Library*‚Äù button on the model page to
    see how to do so. For example, `distilgpt2` shows how to do so with ü§ó Transformers
    below.

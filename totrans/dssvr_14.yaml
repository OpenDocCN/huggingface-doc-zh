    a dataset’s size programmatically. Feel free to also try it out with [ReDoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/openapi.json#operation/getSize).

- en: 'The endpoint response is a JSON containing the size of the dataset, as well
    as each of its configurations and splits. It provides the number of rows, the
    number of colums (where applicable) and the size in bytes for the different forms
    of the data: original files, size in memory (RAM) and auto-converted parquet files.
    For example, the [ibm/duorc](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibm/duorc) dataset
    has 187.213 rows along all its configurations and splits, for a total of 97MB.'

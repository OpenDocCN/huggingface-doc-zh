- en: You can send requests to Inference Endpoints using the UI leveraging the Inference
    Widget or programmatically, e.g. with cURL, `@huggingface/inference`, `huggingface_hub`
    or any REST client. The Endpoint overview not only provides a interactive widget
    for you to test the Endpoint, but also generates code for `python`, `javascript`
    and `curl`. You can use this code to quickly get started with your Endpoint in
    your favorite programming language.

- en: The Endpoint overview provides access to the Inference Widget which can be used
    to send requests (see step 6 of [Create an Endpoint](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/create_endpoint)).
    This allows you to quickly test your Endpoint with different inputs and share
    it with team members.

- en: '*We introduce MADLAD-400, a manually audited, general domain 3T token monolingual
    dataset based on CommonCrawl, spanning 419 languages. We discuss the limitations
    revealed by self-auditing MADLAD-400, and the role data auditing had in the dataset
    creation process. We then train and release a 10.7B-parameter multilingual machine
    translation model on 250 billion tokens covering over 450 languages using publicly
    available data, and find that it is competitive with models that are significantly
    larger, and report the results on different domains. In addition, we train a 8B-parameter
    language model, and assess the results on few-shot translation. We make the baseline
    models 1 available to the research community.*'

- en: Machine learning datasets are commonly organized in *splits* and they may also
    have *configurations*. These internal structures provide the scaffolding for building
    out a dataset, and determines how a dataset should be split and organized. Understanding
    a dataset’s structure can help you create your own dataset, and know which subset
    of data you should use when during model training and evaluation.

    is actually learning instead of *overfitting*, or just memorizing the data.

- en: A *configuration* is a higher-level internal structure than a split, and a configuration
    contains splits. You can think of a configuration as a sub-dataset contained within
    a larger dataset. It is a useful structure for adding additional layers of organization
    to a dataset. For example, if you take a look at the [Multilingual LibriSpeech
    (MLS)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/multilingual_librispeech) dataset,
    you’ll notice there are eight different languages. While you can create a dataset
    containing all eight languages, it’s probably neater to create a dataset with
    each language as a configuration. This way, users can instantly load a dataset
    with their language of interest instead of preprocessing the dataset to filter
    for a specific language.

- en: Configurations are flexible, and can be used to organize a dataset along whatever
    objective you’d like. For example, the [SceneParse150](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scene_parse_150)
    dataset uses configurations to organize the dataset by task. One configuration
    is dedicated to segmenting the whole image, while the other configuration is for
    instance segmentation.

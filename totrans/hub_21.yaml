- en: Counting the number of downloads for models is not a trivial task as a single
    model repository might contain multiple files, including multiple model weight
    files (e.g., with sharded models), and different formats depending on the library.
    To avoid double counting downloads (e.g., counting a single download of a model
    as multiple downloads), the Hub uses a set of query files that are employed for
    download counting. No information is sent from the user, and no additional calls
    are made for this. The count is done server-side as we serve files for downloads.

- en: Every HTTP request to these files, including `GET` and `HEAD` will be counted
    as a download. By default, when no library is specified, the Hub uses `config.json`
    as the default query file. Otherwise, the query file depends on each library,
    and the Hub might examine files such as `pytorch_model.bin` and `adapter_config.json`.

    and `meta.yaml`. For the following set of libraries, there are specific query
    files

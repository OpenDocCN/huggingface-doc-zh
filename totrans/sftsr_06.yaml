- en: PyTorch model weights are commonly saved and stored as `.bin` files with Pythonâ€™s
    [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility. To save and
    store your model weights in the more secure `safetensor` format, we recommend
    converting your weights to `.safetensors`.

- en: The easiest way to convert your model weights is to use the [Convert Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diffusers/convert),
    given your model weights are already stored on the Hub. The Convert Space downloads
    the pickled weights, converts them, and opens a Pull Request to upload the newly
    converted `.safetensors` file to your repository.

- en: For larger models, the Space may be a bit slower because its resources are tied
    up in converting other models. You can also try running the [convert.py](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors/blob/main/bindings/python/convert.py)
    script (this is what the Space is running) locally to convert your weights.

    the Space.

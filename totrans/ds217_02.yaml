- en: Load a dataset in a single line of code, and use our powerful data processing
    methods to quickly get your dataset ready for training in a deep learning model.
    Backed by the Apache Arrow format, process large datasets with zero-copy reads
    without any memory constraints for optimal speed and efficiency. We also feature
    a deep integration with the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets),
    allowing you to easily load and share a dataset with the wider machine learning
    community.

    and [chat()](/docs/transformers/v4.37.2/en/main_classes/agent#transformers.Agent.chat)
    mode. Both the `run` and `chat` modes underlie the same logic. The language model
    powering the agent is conditioned on a long prompt and completes the prompt by
    generating the next tokens until the stop token is reached. The only difference
    between the two modes is that during the `chat` mode the prompt is extended with
    previous user inputs and model generations. This allows the agent to have access
    to past interactions, seemingly giving the agent some kind of memory.

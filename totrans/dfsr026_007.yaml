- en: Welcome to ðŸ§¨ Diffusers! If youâ€™re new to diffusion models and generative AI,
    and want to learn more, then youâ€™ve come to the right place. These beginner-friendly
    tutorials are designed to provide a gentle introduction to diffusion models and
    help you understand the library fundamentals - the core components and how ðŸ§¨ Diffusers
    is meant to be used.

- en: Youâ€™ll learn how to use a pipeline for inference to rapidly generate things,
    and then deconstruct that pipeline to really understand how to use the library
    as a modular toolbox for building your own diffusion systems. In the next lesson,
    youâ€™ll learn how to train your own diffusion model to generate what you want.

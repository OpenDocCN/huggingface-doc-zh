- en: '[TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide) is a lightweight framework
    for deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained devices, such as
    mobile phones, embedded systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. TFLite
    is designed to optimize and run models efficiently on these devices with limited
    computational power, memory, and power consumption. A TensorFlow Lite model is
    represented in a special efficient portable format identified by the `.tflite`
    file extension.'

    a local model, first make sure that you saved both the modelâ€™s weights and tokenizer
    files in the same directory (`local_path`). When using CLI, pass the `local_path`
    to the `model` argument instead of the checkpoint name on ðŸ¤— Hub.

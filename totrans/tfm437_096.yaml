    processing (NLP), speech and audio, computer vision tasks, and some important
    applications of them. This page will look closely at how models solve these tasks
    and explain what’s happening under the hood. There are many ways to solve a given
    task, some models may implement certain techniques or even approach the task from
    a new angle, but for Transformer models, the general idea is the same. Owing to
    its flexible architecture, most models are a variant of an encoder, decoder, or
    encoder-decoder structure. In addition to Transformer models, our library also
    has several convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are still used today for
    computer vision tasks. We’ll also explain how a modern CNN works.

- en: A lightweight decoder takes the last feature map (1/32 scale) from the encoder
    and upsamples it to 1/16 scale. From here, the feature is passed into a *Selective
    Feature Fusion (SFF)* module, which selects and combines local and global features
    from an attention map for each feature and then upsamples it to 1/8th. This process
    is repeated until the decoded features are the same size as the original image.
    The output is passed through two convolution layers and then a sigmoid activation
    is applied to predict the depth of each pixel.

- en: BART’s encoder architecture is very similar to BERT and accepts a token and
    positional embedding of the text. BART is pretrained by corrupting the input and
    then reconstructing it with the decoder. Unlike other encoders with specific corruption
    strategies, BART can apply any type of corruption. The *text infilling* corruption
    strategy works the best though. In text infilling, a number of text spans are
    replaced with a **single** `mask` token. This is important because the model has
    to predict the masked tokens, and it teaches the model to predict the number of
    missing tokens. The input embeddings and masked spans are passed through the encoder
    to output some final hidden states, but unlike BERT, BART doesn’t add a final
    feedforward network at the end to predict a word.

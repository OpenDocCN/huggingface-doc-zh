- en: If youâ€™re interested in having a model that you can [readily deploy for inference](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/new),
    take a look at our [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints)
    solution! It is a secure production environment with dedicated and autoscaling
    infrastructure, and you have the flexibility to choose between CPU and GPU resources.

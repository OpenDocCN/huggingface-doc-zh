- en: '*We introduce Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), a novel training approach
    that efficiently samples large-scale foundational image diffusion models in just
    1â€“4 steps while maintaining high image quality. We use score distillation to leverage
    large-scale off-the-shelf image diffusion models as a teacher signal in combination
    with an adversarial loss to ensure high image fidelity even in the low-step regime
    of one or two sampling steps. Our analyses show that our model clearly outperforms
    existing few-step methods (GANs,Latent Consistency Models) in a single step and
    reaches the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models (SDXL) in only four
    steps. ADD is the first method to unlock single-step, real-time image synthesis
    with foundation models.*'

- en: SDXL Turbo uses the exact same architecture as [SDXL](./stable_diffusion_xl),
    which means it also has the same API. Please refer to the [SDXL](./stable_diffusion_xl)
    API reference for more details.

    specific metrics that can be used to compare models. For example, a series of
    different metrics have been proposed for text generation, ranging from [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu)
    and its derivatives such as [GoogleBLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/google_bleu)
    and [GLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/gleu), but also [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/rouge),

    first you need to choose the one that corresponds to the NLI task, such as mnli,
    which is described as “crowdsourced collection of sentence pairs with textual
    entailment annotations”

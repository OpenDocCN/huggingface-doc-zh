    What
    we've talked about so far is Reinforcement Learning. But where does the "Deep"
    come into play?

- en: Deep Reinforcement Learning introduces **deep neural networks to solve Reinforcement
    Learning problems** — hence the name “deep”.

    Reinforcement Learning) and then Deep Q-Learning.

- en: You’ll see the difference is that, in the first approach, **we use a traditional
    algorithm** to create a Q table that helps us find what action to take for each
    state.

- en: In the second approach, **we will use a Neural Network** (to approximate the
    Q value).

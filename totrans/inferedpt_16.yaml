    currently offer three different levels of security: [Public, Protected and Private](/docs/inference-endpoints/security).'

- en: Public and Protected Endpoints do not require any additional configuration.
    But in order to create a Private Endpoint for a secure intra-region connection,
    you need to provide the AWS Account ID of the account which should also have access
    to Inference Endpoints.

- en: After you provide your AWS Account ID and click **Create Endpoint**, the Inference
    Service creates a VPC Endpoint and you should see the VPC Service Name in your
    overview.

- en: The VPC Service Name is used to create the VPC Interface Endpoint in your (customer)
    cloud account. Open your cloud account [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#Endpoints)
    to go create the VPC Interface Endpoint.

    select the VPC and subnets, as well as the security groups you want to use.

    AWS account and add the VPC Endpoint as the endpoint.

- en: After the VPC Endpoint status changes from **pending** to **available**, you
    should see a Endpoint URL in the overview. This URL can now be used inside your
    VPC to access your Endpoint in a secure and protected way, ensuring traffic is
    only occurring between the two endpoints and will never leave AWS.

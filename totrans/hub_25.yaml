- en: The Hugging Face Hub hosts a [large number of community-curated datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets)
    for a diverse range of tasks such as translation, automatic speech recognition,
    and image classification. Alongside the information contained in the [dataset
    card](./datasets-cards), many datasets, such as [GLUE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue),
    include a [Dataset Viewer](./datasets-viewer) to showcase the data.

- en: Each dataset is a [Git repository](./repositories) that contains the data required
    to generate splits for training, evaluation, and testing. For information on how
    a dataset repository is structured, refer to the [Data files Configuration page](./datasets-data-files-configuration).
    Following the supported repo structure will ensure that the dataset page on the
    Hub will have a Viewer.

    and public](./repositories-settings#private-repositories) through the Settings
    tab. If a dataset is owned by an [organization](./organizations), the privacy
    settings apply to all the members of the organization.

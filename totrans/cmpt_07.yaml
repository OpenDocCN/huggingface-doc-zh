    place. It is a space where you can submit your model and get a score. It is also
    a space where competitors can see the leaderboard, discuss, and make submissions.

    competition space. This token must be kept alive for the duration of the competition.
    In case the token expires, the competition space will stop working. If you change/refresh/delete
    this token, you will need to update this secret.'

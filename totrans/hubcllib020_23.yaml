- en: The `huggingface_hub` library is a library for interacting with the Hugging
    Face Hub, which is a collections of git-based repositories (models, datasets or
    Spaces). There are two main ways to access the Hub using `huggingface_hub`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first approach, the so-called ‚Äúgit-based‚Äù approach, is led by the [Repository](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/repository#huggingface_hub.Repository)
    class. This method uses a wrapper around the `git` command with additional functions
    specifically designed to interact with the Hub. The second option, called the
    ‚ÄúHTTP-based‚Äù approach, involves making HTTP requests using the [HfApi](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/hf_api#huggingface_hub.HfApi)
    client. Let‚Äôs examine the pros and cons of each approach.

- en: At first, `huggingface_hub` was mostly built around the [Repository](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/repository#huggingface_hub.Repository)
    class. It provides Python wrappers for common `git` commands such as `"git add"`,
    `"git commit"`, `"git push"`, `"git tag"`, `"git checkout"`, etc.

- en: The library also helps with setting credentials and tracking large files, which
    are often used in machine learning repositories. Additionally, the library allows
    you to execute its methods in the background, making it useful for uploading data
    during training.

- en: The main advantage of using a [Repository](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/repository#huggingface_hub.Repository)
    is that it allows you to maintain a local copy of the entire repository on your
    machine. This can also be a disadvantage as it requires you to constantly update
    and maintain this local copy. This is similar to traditional software development
    where each developer maintains their own local copy and pushes changes when working
    on a feature. However, in the context of machine learning, this may not always
    be necessary as users may only need to download weights for inference or convert
    weights from one format to another without the need to clone the entire repository.

    is now deprecated in favor of the http-based alternatives. Given its large adoption
    in legacy code, the complete removal of [Repository](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/repository#huggingface_hub.Repository)
    will only happen in release `v1.0`.'

- en: The [HfApi](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/hf_api#huggingface_hub.HfApi)
    class was developed to provide an alternative to local git repositories, which
    can be cumbersome to maintain, especially when dealing with large models or datasets.
    The [HfApi](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/hf_api#huggingface_hub.HfApi)
    class offers the same functionality as git-based approaches, such as downloading
    and pushing files and creating branches and tags, but without the need for a local
    folder that needs to be kept in sync.

    class offers additional features, such as the ability to manage repos, download
    files using caching for efficient reuse, search the Hub for repos and metadata,
    access community features such as discussions, PRs, and comments, and configure
    Spaces hardware and secrets.

    in all cases. [HfApi](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/hf_api#huggingface_hub.HfApi)
    allows to pull and push changes, work with PRs, tags and branches, interact with
    discussions and much more. Since the `0.16` release, the http-based methods can
    also run in the background, which was the last major advantage of the [Repository](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/repository#huggingface_hub.Repository)
    class.

    Some may never be implemented, but we are always trying to improve and close the
    gap. If you don‚Äôt see your use case covered, please open [an issue on Github](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub)!
    We welcome feedback to help build the ü§ó ecosystem with and for our users.

    over the git-based [Repository](/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.3/en/package_reference/repository#huggingface_hub.Repository)
    does not mean that git versioning will disappear from the Hugging Face Hub anytime
    soon. It will always be possible to use `git` commands locally in workflows where
    it makes sense.

    on society, we think it is important to provide the project with ethical guidelines
    to guide the development, usersâ€™ contributions, and usage of the Diffusers library.

    to name a few: copyrights issues for artists; deep-fake exploitation; sexual content
    generation in inappropriate contexts; non-consensual impersonation; harmful social
    biases perpetuating the oppression of marginalized groups. We will keep tracking
    risks and adapt the following guidelines based on the communityâ€™s responsiveness
    and valuable feedback.'

    them when dealing with ethically sensitive issues while making a technical choice.
    Furthermore, we commit to adapting those ethical principles over time following
    emerging harms related to the state of the art of the technology in question.

- en: Token classification is the task of classifying each token in a sequence. This
    can be used for Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging,
    and more. Get your data ready in proper format and then with just a few clicks,
    your state-of-the-art model will be ready to be used in production.

- en: As you can see, we have two columns in the CSV file. One column is the tokens
    and the other is the tags. Both the columns are stringified lists! The tokens
    column contains the tokens of the sentence and the tags column contains the tags
    for each token.

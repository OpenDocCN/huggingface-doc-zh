    on finishing the tutorial. Youâ€™ve just coded your first Deep Reinforcement Learning
    agent from scratch using PyTorch and shared it on the Hub ðŸ¥³.'

    more complex environments** (for instance, what about changing the network to
    a Convolutional Neural Network to handle frames as observation)?

    agents in Unity environments. This way, you will be ready to participate in the
    **AI vs AI challenges where youâ€™ll train your agents to compete against other
    agents in a snowball fight and a soccer game.**

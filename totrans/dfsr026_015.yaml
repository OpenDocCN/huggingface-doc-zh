- en: ðŸ§¨ Diffusers offers many pipelines, models, and schedulers for generative tasks.
    To make loading these components as simple as possible, we provide a single and
    unified method - `from_pretrained()` - that loads any of these components from
    either the Hugging Face [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=downloads)
    or your local machine. Whenever you load a pipeline or model, the latest files
    are automatically downloaded and cached so you can quickly reuse them next time
    without redownloading the files.

- en: This section will show you everything you need to know about loading pipelines,
    how to load different components in a pipeline, how to load checkpoint variants,
    and how to load community pipelines. Youâ€™ll also learn how to load schedulers
    and compare the speed and quality trade-offs of using different schedulers. Finally,
    youâ€™ll see how to convert and load KerasCV checkpoints so you can use them in
    PyTorch with ðŸ§¨ Diffusers.

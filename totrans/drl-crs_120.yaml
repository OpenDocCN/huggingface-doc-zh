    for the documentation of these systems has grown**.

    it is stored, when it was collected, who was involved, etc. — or the model optimization
    framework — the architecture, evaluation metrics, relevant papers, etc. — and
    more.

    on the Hub (see documentation [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards)).

    you can learn about its creation process.

    or dataset are created, leaving them to go un-updated when these models are built
    into evolving systems in the future. ​

- en: Reinforcement learning systems are fundamentally designed to optimize based
    on measurements of reward and time. While the notion of a reward function can
    be mapped nicely to many well-understood fields of supervised learning (via a
    loss function), understanding of how machine learning systems evolve over time
    is limited.

    (the pithy naming is designed to mirror the popular papers *Model Cards for Model
    Reporting* and *Datasheets for Datasets*). The goal is to propose a type of documentation
    focused on the **human factors of reward** and **time-varying feedback systems**.

    and [datasheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) proposed by Mitchell et al.
    and Gebru et al., we argue the need for Reward Reports for AI systems.

    different RL applications, roadblocks to system interpretability, and the resonances
    between deployed supervised machine learning systems and the sequential decision-making
    utilized in RL.

    on these questions and begin the work of deciding how to resolve them in practice.

    ML systems is a *change-log*. The change-log updates information from the designer
    (changed training parameters, data, etc.) along with noticed changes from the
    user (harmful behavior, unexpected responses, etc.).

    effects.

    and behind the closed doors of private corporations. These corporations are largely
    without regulation, so the burden of documentation falls on the public.

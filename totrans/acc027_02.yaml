- en: ðŸ¤— Accelerate is a library that enables the same PyTorch code to be run across
    any distributed configuration by adding just four lines of code! In short, training
    and inference at scale made simple, efficient and adaptable.

- en: Built on `torch_xla` and `torch.distributed`, ðŸ¤— Accelerate takes care of the
    heavy lifting, so you donâ€™t have to write any custom code to adapt to these platforms.
    Convert existing codebases to utilize [DeepSpeed](usage_guides/deepspeed), perform
    [fully sharded data parallelism](usage_guides/fsdp), and have automatic support
    for mixed-precision training!

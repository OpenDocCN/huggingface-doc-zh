- en: If you are using Hugging Face open source libraries, you can make your Space
    restart faster by setting the environment variable `HF_HOME` to `/data/.huggingface`.
    Libraries like `transformers`, `diffusers`, `datasets` and others use that environment
    variable to cache any assets downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub. Setting this
    variable to the persistent storage path will make sure that cached resources do
    not need to be re-downloaded when the Space is restarted.

- en: You can find an example of persistence [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Wauplin/space_to_dataset_saver),
    which uses the [`huggingface_hub` library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index)
    for programmatically uploading files to a dataset repository. This Space example
    along with [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/guides/upload#scheduled-uploads)
    will help you define which solution fits best your data type.

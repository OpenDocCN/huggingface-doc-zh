- en: Normally, it isnâ€™t possible to mix different adapter types in ðŸ¤— PEFT. You can
    create a PEFT model with two different LoRA adapters (which can have different
    config options), but it is not possible to combine a LoRA and LoHa adapter. With
    [PeftMixedModel](/docs/peft/v0.8.2/en/package_reference/peft_model#peft.PeftMixedModel)
    however, this works as long as the adapter types are compatible. The main purpose
    of allowing mixed adapter types is to combine trained adapters for inference.
    While it is possible to train a mixed adapter model, this has not been tested
    and is not recommended.

    method is necessary to activate both adapters, otherwise only the first adapter
    would be active. You can keep adding more adapters by calling [add_adapter()](/docs/peft/v0.8.2/en/package_reference/peft_model#peft.PeftModel.add_adapter)
    repeatedly.

    for combining adapters with very different configs.

- en: If you want to combine a lot of different adapters, the most performant way
    to do it is to consecutively add the same adapter types. For example, add LoRA1,
    LoRA2, LoHa1, LoHa2 in this order, instead of LoRA1, LoHa1, LoRA2, and LoHa2\.
    While the order can affect the output, there is no inherently *best* order, so
    it is best to choose the fastest one.

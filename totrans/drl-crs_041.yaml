    on finishing the tutorials. Youâ€™ve just implemented your first RL agent from scratch
    and shared it on the Hub ðŸ¥³.

    Reinforcement Learning algorithm based on Q-Learning: Deep Q-Learning. And youâ€™ll
    train a **DQN agent with [RL-Baselines3 Zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo)
    to play Atari Games**.'

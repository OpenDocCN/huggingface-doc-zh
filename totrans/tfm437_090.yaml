    be done as following.

    run on it (user fork branches, non-forked branches, branches originating from
    github.com UI direct file edit, various forced pushes, etc. - there are so many)

    job as successful, but CircleCI and Github Actions as of this writing donâ€™t support

    or job with the rest of the normal jobs, while removing `set +euo pipefail` or
    any other things you may have added to ensure that the experimental job doesnâ€™t
    interfere with the normal CI functioning.

- en: This whole process would have been much easier if we only could set something
    like `allow-failure` for the experimental step, and let it fail without impacting
    the overall status of PRs. But as mentioned earlier CircleCI and Github Actions
    donâ€™t support it at the moment.

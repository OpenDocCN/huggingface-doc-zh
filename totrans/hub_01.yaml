- en: The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 350k models, 75k datasets, and
    150k demo apps (Spaces), all open source and publicly available, in an online
    platform where people can easily collaborate and build ML together. The Hub works
    as a central place where anyone can explore, experiment, collaborate, and build
    technology with Machine Learning. Are you ready to join the path towards open
    source Machine Learning? ü§ó

    50k demos in which people can easily collaborate in their ML workflows. The Hub
    works as a central place where anyone can share, explore, discover, and experiment
    with open-source Machine Learning.

    themselves ‚Äì the only way we‚Äôll achieve this is by sharing knowledge and resources
    in a community-centric approach. We are building the largest open-source collection
    of models, datasets, demos and metrics on the Hugging Face Hub to democratize
    and advance ML for everyone üöÄ.

- en: You can discover and use dozens of thousands of open-source ML models shared
    by the community. To promote responsible model usage and development, model repos
    are equipped with [Model Cards](./model-cards) to inform users of each model‚Äôs
    limitations and biases. Additional [metadata](./model-cards#model-card-metadata)
    about info such as their tasks, languages, and metrics can be included, with training
    metrics charts even added if the repository contains [TensorBoard traces](./tensorboard).
    It‚Äôs also easy to add an [**inference widget**](./models-widgets) to your model,
    allowing anyone to play with the model directly in the browser! For programmatic
    access, an API is provided to [**instantly serve your model**](./models-inference).

- en: To upload models to the Hub, or download models and integrate them into your
    work, explore the [**Models documentation**](./models). You can also choose from
    [**over a dozen libraries**](./models-libraries) such as ü§ó Transformers, Asteroid,
    and ESPnet that support the Hub.

- en: The Hub is home to over 5,000 datasets in more than 100 languages that can be
    used for a broad range of tasks across NLP, Computer Vision, and Audio. The Hub
    makes it simple to find, download, and upload datasets. Datasets are accompanied
    by extensive documentation in the form of [**Dataset Cards**](./model-cards) and
    [**Dataset Preview**](./datasets-overview#datasets-on-the-hub) to let you explore
    the data directly in your browser. While many datasets are public, [**organizations**](./organizations)
    and individuals can create private datasets to comply with licensing or privacy
    issues. You can learn more about [**Datasets here on Hugging Face Hub documentation**](./datasets-overview).

- en: The [ü§ó `datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) library allows
    you to programmatically interact with the datasets, so you can easily use datasets
    from the Hub in your projects. With a single line of code, you can access the
    datasets; even if they are so large they don‚Äôt fit in your computer, you can use
    streaming to efficiently access the data.

    be used to group accounts and manage datasets, models, and Spaces. Educators can
    also create collaborative organizations for students using [Hugging Face for Classrooms](https://huggingface.co/classrooms).
    An organization‚Äôs repositories will be featured on the organization‚Äôs page and
    every member of the organization will have the ability to contribute to the repository.
    In addition to conveniently grouping all of an organization‚Äôs work, the Hub allows
    admins to set roles to [**control access to repositories**](./organizations-security),
    and manage their organization‚Äôs [payment method and billing info](https://huggingface.co/pricing).

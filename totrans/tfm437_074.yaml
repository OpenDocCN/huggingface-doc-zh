- en: A TPU is a **Tensor Processing Unit.** They are hardware designed by Google,
    which are used to greatly speed up the tensor computations within neural networks,
    much like GPUs. They can be used for both network training and inference. They
    are generally accessed through Google’s cloud services, but small TPUs can also
    be accessed directly for free through Google Colab and Kaggle Kernels.

- en: New users are often very confused by the range of TPUs, and the different ways
    to access them. The first key distinction to understand is the difference between
    **TPU Nodes** and **TPU VMs.**
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you use a **TPU Node**, you are effectively indirectly accessing a remote
    TPU. You will need a separate VM, which will initialize your network and data
    pipeline and then forward them to the remote node. When you use a TPU on Google
    Colab, you are accessing it in the **TPU Node** style.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using TPU Nodes can have some quite unexpected behaviour for people who aren’t
    used to them! In particular, because the TPU is located on a physically different
    system to the machine you’re running your Python code on, your data cannot be
    local to your machine - any data pipeline that loads from your machine’s internal
    storage will totally fail! Instead, data must be stored in Google Cloud Storage
    where your data pipeline can still access it, even when the pipeline is running
    on the remote TPU node.

- en: If you can fit all your data in memory as `np.ndarray` or `tf.Tensor`, then
    you can `fit()` on that data even when using Colab or a TPU Node, without needing
    to upload it to Google Cloud Storage.

    its higher-level wrapper `model.prepare_tf_dataset()` , which you will see throughout
    our TF code examples, will both fail on a TPU Node. The reason for this is that
    even though they create a `tf.data.Dataset` it is not a “pure” `tf.data` pipeline
    and uses `tf.numpy_function` or `Dataset.from_generator()` to stream data from
    the underlying HuggingFace `Dataset`. This HuggingFace `Dataset` is backed by
    data that is on a local disc and which the remote TPU Node will not be able to
    read.'

- en: The second way to access a TPU is via a **TPU VM.** When using a TPU VM, you
    connect directly to the machine that the TPU is attached to, much like training
    on a GPU VM. TPU VMs are generally easier to work with, particularly when it comes
    to your data pipeline. All of the above warnings do not apply to TPU VMs!

    It is also likely to be unsupported in future - Google’s latest TPU, TPUv4, can
    only be accessed as a TPU VM, which suggests that TPU Nodes are increasingly going
    to become a “legacy” access method. However, we understand that the only free
    TPU access is on Colab and Kaggle Kernels, which uses TPU Node - so we’ll try
    to explain how to handle it if you have to! Check the [TPU example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb)

- en: XLA is an optimizing compiler, used by both TensorFlow and JAX. In JAX it is
    the only compiler, whereas in TensorFlow it is optional (but mandatory on TPU!).
    The easiest way to enable it when training a Keras model is to pass the argument
    `jit_compile=True` to `model.compile()`. If you don’t get any errors and performance
    is good, that’s a great sign that you’re ready to move to TPU!
  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Debugging on TPU is generally a bit harder than on CPU/GPU, so we recommend
    getting your code running on CPU/GPU with XLA first before trying it on TPU. You
    don’t have to train for long, of course - just for a few steps to make sure that
    your model and data pipeline are working like you expect them to.

    XLA will have to recompile your model over and over, which will create huge performance
    problems. This commonly arises in NLP models, where input texts have variable
    lengths after tokenization. In other modalities, static shapes are more common

    excessive padding can cause severe slowdown too - if you pad all your samples

    One very useful trick is to **pad batches of samples up to a multiple of a number

    amount, but it hugely reduces the number of unique input shapes, because every
    input shape now has to be a multiple of 32 or 64\. Fewer unique input shapes means
    fewer XLA compilations!

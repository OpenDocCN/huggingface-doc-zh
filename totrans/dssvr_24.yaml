- en: Datasets supported by Datasets Server have a tabular format, meaning a data
    point is represented in a row and its features are contained in columns. Using
    the `/first-rows` endpoint allows you to preview the first 100 rows of a dataset
    and information about each feature. Within the `features` key, you’ll notice it
    returns a `_type` field. This value describes the data type of the column, and
    it is also known as a dataset’s [`Features`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/about_dataset_features).

- en: There are several different data `Features` for representing different data
    formats such as [`Audio`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.5.2/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Audio)
    and [`Image`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.5.2/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Image)
    for speech and image data respectively. Knowing a dataset feature gives you a
    better understanding of the data type you’re working with, and how you can preprocess
    it.

- en: The `text` column has a type of `Value`. The [`Value`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.5.2/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Value)
    type is extremely versatile and represents scalar values such as strings, integers,
    dates, and even timestamp values.

- en: The `label` column has a type of `ClassLabel`. The [`ClassLabel`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.5.2/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.ClassLabel)
    type represents the number of classes in a dataset and their label names. Naturally,
    this means you’ll frequently see `ClassLabel` used in classification datasets.

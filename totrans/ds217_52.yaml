- en: '[Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) enables large amounts of data to be processed
    and moved quickly. It is a specific data format that stores data in a columnar
    memory layout. This provides several significant advantages:'

- en: Arrow‚Äôs standard format allows [zero-copy reads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy)
    which removes virtually all serialization overhead.

- en: Arrow is column-oriented so it is faster at querying and processing slices or
    columns of data.

- en: ü§ó Datasets uses Arrow for its local caching system. It allows datasets to be
    backed by an on-disk cache, which is memory-mapped for fast lookup. This architecture
    allows for large datasets to be used on machines with relatively small device
    memory.

- en: This is possible because the Arrow data is actually memory-mapped from disk,
    and not loaded in memory. Memory-mapping allows access to data on disk, and leverages
    virtual memory capabilities for fast lookups.

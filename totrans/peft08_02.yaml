- en: ðŸ¤— PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a library for efficiently adapting
    large pretrained models to various downstream applications without fine-tuning
    all of a modelâ€™s parameters because it is prohibitively costly. PEFT methods only
    fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters - significantly decreasing
    computational and storage costs - while yielding performance comparable to a fully
    fine-tuned model. This makes it more accessible to train and store large language
    models (LLMs) on consumer hardware.
